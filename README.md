## [The JOIN Operation](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/The_JOIN_operation)


    SELECT matchid, player
    FROM goal 
    WHERE teamid = 'GER'

    SELECT DISTINCT id,stadium,team1,team2
    FROM game JOIN goal ON goal.matchid = game.id
    WHERE id = 1012

    SELECT player,teamid,mdate
    FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
    WHERE teamid='GER'

    SELECT team1,team2,player

    FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
    WHERE teamid = 'GER'
    GROUP BY matchid


    SELECT DISTINCT mdate, 
    team1,
    SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1, 
    team2,
