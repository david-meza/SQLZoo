## Select Basics

    SELECT population FROM world
    WHERE name = 'Germany'

    SELECT name, gdp/population FROM world
    WHERE area > 5000000

    SELECT name , continent
    FROM world
    WHERE area < 2000
      AND gdp > 5000000000

    SELECT name, population FROM world
    WHERE name IN ('Finland', 'Norway',
                 'Denmark', 'Sweden')

    SELECT name FROM world
    WHERE name LIKE 'G%'

    SELECT name, area/1000 AS area_in_thousands 
    FROM world
    WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000

## [The JOIN Operation](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/The_JOIN_operation)


    SELECT matchid, player
    FROM goal 
    WHERE teamid = 'GER'

    SELECT DISTINCT id,stadium,team1,team2
    FROM game JOIN goal ON goal.matchid = game.id
    WHERE id = 1012

    SELECT player,teamid,mdate
    FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
    WHERE teamid='GER'

    SELECT team1,team2,player
    FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
    WHERE player LIKE 'Mario%'

    SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime
    FROM goal JOIN eteam ON teamid=id
    WHERE gtime<=10

    SELECT mdate,teamname
    FROM game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id)
    WHERE coach = 'Fernando Santos'

    SELECT player
    FROM goal JOIN game ON goal.matchid=id
    WHERE stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

### More difficult Questions

    SELECT DISTINCT(player)
    FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
    WHERE (team1='GER' OR team2='GER') AND teamid != 'GER'


    SELECT teamname, COUNT(*)
    FROM eteam JOIN goal ON id=teamid
    GROUP BY teamname
    ORDER BY teamname


    SELECT stadium, COUNT(*)
    FROM game JOIN goal ON id = matchid
    GROUP BY stadium
    ORDER BY stadium


    SELECT matchid,mdate, COUNT(*)
    FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
    WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
    GROUP BY matchid


    SELECT matchid,mdate, COUNT(*)
    FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
    WHERE teamid = 'GER'
    GROUP BY matchid


    SELECT DISTINCT mdate, team1,
    SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1, team2, SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
    FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
    GROUP BY matchid
    ORDER BY mdate,team1,team2
